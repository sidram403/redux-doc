# Three Principleâ€™s of Redux

## 1. First Principle
### The state of your application is stored in an object within a single state.
Maintain application state in a single object which would be managed by the Redux Store.

### Example :
Let's assume we are tracking the number of cakes on the shelf
```
 {
	   NumberOfCakes:10
 }
```
